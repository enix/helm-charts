Thank you for using SAN iSCSI CSI driver. It will be soon up and running.

In order to dynamically provide a persistant volume, you have to create a storage class first. Please refer to this example to do so: https://github.com/enix/san-iscsi-csi/blob/main/example/storage-class.yaml
Don't forget to install packages open-iscsi and multipath-tools on your hosts if it's not done yet, make sure iscsid and multipathd are running and that you added the configuration file for multipathd given in the README.md file, available in the github repository (https://github.com/enix/san-iscsi-csi/blob/main/README.md#multipathd-additionnal-configuration).
